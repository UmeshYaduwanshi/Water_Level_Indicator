# Water_level
The ESP8266 and Blynk-based Water Level Indicator and Pump Controller is a smart system designed to monitor and manage the water level in a tank while providing both automated and manual control over a water pump. This project ensures efficient water management by automatically turning the pump on when the tank water level drops to 10% and turning it off when the tank is filled to 100%. Additionally, users have the flexibility to manually control the pump and monitor the water level through the Blynk mobile app.
